**Giphy API**

- Use GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice.
- When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
- When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
- The rating of each gif will also appear on the page.
- Yu can add a new topic from searching on the right side of the page. The actions will be added to the array of actions and added as a new button. It will reset to default topics if you reload the page.
